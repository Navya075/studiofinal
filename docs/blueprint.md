## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light desaturated blue (#B0E2FF) to represent technical collaboration with a calming effect.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF) to give a clean, professional, and approachable feel.
- Accent color: A slightly darker analogous blue (#94C6FF) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for its clean, modern and neutral readability for long format text.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, to provide a computerized, scientific feel to short blocks of text
- Use flat, modern icons with color-coding (Blue for technical, Purple for creative, Green for management, Orange for Hackathons).
- Implement a desktop-first, responsive design with rounded cards, glassmorphism/soft shadows, and a clean, modern dashboard layout.
- Use smooth hover animations and subtle transitions to enhance user interaction and provide visual feedback.
